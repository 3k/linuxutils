Command line script to manage the database of the workaround.org 
"ISP-style Email Server with Debian" tutorial:

http://workaround.org/ispmail

Newer versions of the tutorial probably changed the database 
layout, so this may not work for you.

This script was originally written by Christoph Haas for 
SQLAlchemy 0.3. I ported it to SQLAlchemy 0.6, but haven't tested
all the functionality of the port in full, so use at your own risk.
